                <p><strong class="first"><bold>I</bold></strong> have no idea what to talk about this time. I actually run out of ideas. So i just type the words that run through my mind right now.
                I think I just want to talk about my opinion on goat or specifically G.O.A.T. Yes, I mean the song from Polyphia. I just remembered the first time I heard the song. It was just mesmerized. 
                Than I found out that the guitar play in this song is actually very hard. Just want to share that I am very noob and sucks in playing guitar. I took around 2 months just to learn to play one song and at the end I really dont master the song.
                I still play like a shit. Somehow a vey simple chord transition really hard for me even now. And this song just make me look more dumb.</p>

                    <p class="mation" id="matoin">Polyphia first achieved mainstream success when the guitar play-through of "Impassion", from their EP Inspire, went viral on YouTube. 
                        Since then, the band's popularity has grown and they have shared the stage with progressive metalcore artists such as Periphery, Between the Buried and Me, and August Burns Red.</p>
